Proof of Concept showcasing Fuse Integration Services (FIS) and SpringBoot
===========================


This project contains a set of use cases demonstrating Fuse Integration Services (FIS) and SpringBoot.  Specifically, exposing an exisiting relational datasource using REST / SOAP, XA transactions between JMS and a RDBMS, and integration with a proprietary Fax service.

See the use cases for [REST wrapper around a relational datasource](./fis-org-lookup-service/readme.md).
